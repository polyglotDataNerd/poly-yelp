We meet farmers before we meet landlords. We turn our new neighbors into friends. We're building a brand that connects to local neighborhoods and leaves communities better off than we found them. We've worked hard to build a company with passion and purpose - and we're just getting started."

            "text": "Solid sweetgreen location. Even with two entire walls lined with dedicated shelves for order pick-up, the lines during the workday between 11:30-2:30pm can be ridiculously long, often 20-30 people deep. Aside from these times the wait for ordering in person isn&amp;#39;t too bad. <br&gt;<br&gt;Like most lunch salad places there are a couple options to order:<br&gt;1) you start with a base, and request the servers to add the components you want as you move down the line. Usually it comes with 3 add-ins and a dressing of your choice, but this option is a little annoying bc was they don&amp;#39;t post any prices of what&amp;#39;s included as a regular add-in and which are extra, and exactly how much extra. And they don&amp;#39;t always have the same items available each season. <br&gt;2) go with their basic or seasonal cold or warm salad recommendations that come with pre-set ingredients. Most of these are pretty darn tasty--I&amp;#39;d say most of the better tasting compared to some other salad places like Chopt or Just Salad.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall if you are looking for a delicious salad and don&amp;#39;t mind paying around $15 for it then sweetgreen is the way to go.",
