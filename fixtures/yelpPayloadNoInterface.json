They worked hard, timely, and they are expert tetris players because I have no idea how they fit everything we had in their truck. The best part was they were all so friendly. I will definitely be asking for these guys again. Thanks guys for making our move painless.",

I was able to make an appointment for the movers right away.<br&gt;<br&gt;The movers, Leo and Tracy, were really awesome. They arrived on time and did such a great job. They were careful with every item and made sure to wrap things properly with plastic wrap and/or cloth wraps. They also made a last check to make sure nothing was left.<br&gt;<br&gt;When they arrived to the house, they were very quick in unloading. They were mindful of taking of their shoes in the house, and they made sure that each item was where I wanted it to be. <br&gt;<br&gt;One thing that was really great was that they helped move an old refrigerator out and replaced it with the refrigerator from my previous place. It was unexpected because I planned on leaving the refrigerator in the garage. I found out that day that the old refrigerator was not working properly anymore, and they agreed to help swap it out. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, my experience with Family Affair Moving was very smooth and more than I expected. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to move!",

Gina answered my initial inquiry promptly, and she set up an in-person consultation with John to come check out our old apartment and give a rough estimate of how much services would cost. They were able to schedule us in with an 8am - 9am arrival window, and the crew arrived right on time. (There were also courtesy calls the night before to remind us of our appointment  and one from the crew with their ETA.)<br&gt;<br&gt;Our movers were Desmond, Aaron, and Gustavo, and they did a great job! All 3 were professional, courteous, friendly, and EXTREMELY hard working! They made sure to let us know about any scuffs or marks they saw on our furniture before wrapping it up, and if any of the pieces were wobbly or slightly bent they treated them with care. They really hustled and seemed to really know their job. Everyone at Family Affair Moving was great and we will definitely use them for any future moves we do.",

Prompt responses, upfront and no BS. John called the night before the move to confirm and let me know what time the guys would be showing up. <br&gt;Moving Day: I&amp;#39;m up at 2:30am worrying about EVERYTHING. Little did I know that Anthony, Gene, and Henry would be my angels to help me. They called to announce arrival time about 45 minutes ahead. They had me packed up and ready to roll in 3 hours! Amazing! My belongings were packed carefully, everything was wrapped and protected with blankets and plastic. These guys humped up and down the stairs both here and my new place. They were kind enough to assemble furniture that they had broken down for transport. They asked where to place things. They were so darn careful and considerate, I COULDN&amp;#39;T BE HAPPIER!<br&gt;This move was flawless and perfect!                                                            The best part of the entire day was watching the guys work as a true team. They helped each other, were kind and polite to each other and even at the bitter end of the move (when everyone is sweaty and tired....) no one was mean or bitchy. This was GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!       Thank you Family Affair Moving! We&amp;#39;ll be calling soon for the second half  to put the rest in storage.....",

            "text": "I called Family Affair Moving based on reviews from Yelp and I was very happy with the service!  I was downsizing from a 3200 square foot, 3 story house to a 1300 square foot house and had a lot of places for furniture to go - two garages, my new home, and a storage unit.  It was complicated logistically, but the three men that helped me on Monday remembered it all!  Leo, Sergio, and Carlton were amazing in so many ways!  They were kind (a big plus), helpful, careful, and always seem to have a cheerful attitude.  Although it is November, it was about 85 degrees on Monday (and three flights of stairs to go up and down (but mostly up as my bedrooms were on the lower level) and so it was physically tiring with the heat, however no complaints from any of the three men!   <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to find movers that you trust with your furniture.  I had so much furniture damaged with my last move in 2012 (from another moving company) and so I was concerned with finding a good one for this move.  I will definitely be calling Family Affair Moving for any future moves and will be recommending them to anyone I know that needs to move!  I was very happy with the professionalism of the company and the movers sent.  Thank you Leo, Sergio and Carlton for all your help!!  I am so appreciative!",

They moved me from a second floor 1 bedroom apartment to a different city 1 bedroom place also on the second floor! No problem with the stairs, tight spaces and did I say they HUSTLED! They made sure all my furniture was protected from scratching or getting dirty. These guys came to work, which I really appreciated. This was an awesome set of movers at an affordable price! Will use them and recommend them like crazy if I ever need to move again! Thank you Joe and Henry!!! I also want to add that the reservation gal, Jeanne, was also quick to respond and so helpful with preparing me for moving day! The whole team made everything run so smooth and efficient! Thanks again #FamilyAffairMoving !!!",

            "text": "Communication was great, and they arrived when promised with all the required supplies to complete my move. The three men worked hard, and all fees were discussed upfront with no surprises at the end. <br&gt;<br&gt;My only concern was that one of the men, who said he had been with the company just one month, was a little careless with items at times. We had some broken glassware as a result of one box falling from the top of a high stack of items he was wheeling down the hall. You do sign something up front that says the movers cannot be held responsible for items that break during the move if it was something you personally packed, but if the stack hadn&amp;#39;t been piled up so high, the box wouldn&amp;#39;t have fallen off. So just make sure you pack well enough for fragile items to survive if they fall over. <br&gt;<br&gt;Edit to add: Jon from Family Affair immediately reached out to me after my initial review to find our more about what happened with the broken glass. I&amp;#39;m really impressed with the level of customer service I&amp;#39;ve received, and will be using this company again for future moves. Thank you Jon and team!",

Unfortunately, I&amp;#39;m on my own with family being overseas or unavailable due to medical conditions so packing up and moving three bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, and storage shed was going to be an insurmountable task. FAM staff from administration (Jon and Gina) to the actual movers (Anthony, Gene and Henry) were outstandingly courteous, patient, quick and thorough. The movers asked questions about how things should be packed, where items should be placed, and they were careful and detailed with my items. I cannot stress how much help they really gave me, and their prices were explained and reasonable with no time wasted. I would highly recommend this company to anyone! Thanks again guys!",

Benjamin arrived with a team of three other hard-working gents, who made sure to treat even simplest ceramic planter with the care reserved for a flatscreen TV. Benjamin, Tetris-master, got our three storage units well-placed in the truck and safely to our new home. Silicone pathways were laid out to protect our floors as the crew made sure every piece was placed in the appropriate spot.
